Cloud Storage Systems Comparison: GCS vs. AWS vs. Azure
Introduction
Cloud storage has become an essential part of modern distributed systems, enabling businesses and individuals to store, access, and manage data remotely. In this comparison, we analyze three major cloud storage services: Google Cloud Storage (GCS), Amazon S3 (AWS), and Azure Blob Storage. Each of these platforms provides scalable and reliable storage solutions but differs in features, pricing, and use cases.

Key Features & Overview
Google Cloud Storage (GCS)
Offers four storage classes: Standard, Nearline, Coldline, and Archive.
Strong integration with Google services like BigQuery and AI/ML tools.
Uses IAM for access control and provides encryption by default.
Provides multi-regional and regional options for high availability.
Features competitive pricing with automatic tiering.
Amazon S3 (AWS)
Supports multiple storage classes, including Standard, Intelligent-Tiering, Glacier, and Deep Archive.
Seamlessly integrates with AWS services such as Lambda and DynamoDB.
Uses IAM and S3 Bucket Policies for fine-grained security control.
Offers high durability (99.999999999%) and global availability.
Uses a pay-as-you-go pricing model.
Azure Blob Storage
Provides three storage tiers: Hot, Cool, and Archive.
Works well with Microsoft services like Azure Functions and AI tools.
Implements Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Microsoft Defender for advanced security.
Supports Geo-Redundant Storage (GRS) for high availability.
Features tier-based cost-effective pricing for Microsoft users.
